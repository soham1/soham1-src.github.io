    <div class="mdl-card__supporting-text">
        You are probably thinking that this website is just a static website with CSS and HTML. In reality, this website uses Angular 2, Material Design Lite, and Webpacks. Angular 2 is used to fetch all my information from JSON files and to display them without
        refreshing the page. Webpacks is used to bundle my application and to make load times quicker. Lastly, Material Design Lite was used to make an eye-appealing UI.

    <div class="mdl-card__supporting-text">
        In today's world, there is no company that uses simple HTML and CSS to make their websites. Companies use modern frameworks to create dynamic websites. To showcase my ability to use these frameworks, I decided to use them in my website.

        Yes, the source code is for this website is open-source. You can find its source code <a href="https://github.com/soham1/soham1-src.github.io">here</a>. I made it public, because I wanted to help others who wanted to use sophisticated frameworks
        in their own website. Primarily, I am making the code public so I can really convince my future employers that I know how to use Angular 2 and Webpacks.
